# Behavior Tree Studio V2 - TBD Notes

Topics to define in V2 (deferred from V1):

- Raw TCP transport support (agent/server integration details).
- SQLite persistence mode (schema, retention, migration).
- Binary payloads for protocol messages.
- Optional payload compression (negotiation + CPU tradeoffs).
- Server-initiated connection to client listener endpoints.
- Non-local security model (authn/authz, secrets, auditing).
- V1 compatibility/migration strategy for protocol and stored data.
